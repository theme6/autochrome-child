### Why a Child Theme?

If you're planning to customize the theme, it is best to use a [Child Theme](http://codex.WordPress.org/Child_Themes). The Child Theme inherits the Parent Theme. Child theme allows you to modify, or add to the functionality of that parent theme. A child theme is the safest and easiest way to modify an existing theme, whether you want to make a few tiny changes or extensive changes. Instead of modifying the theme files directly, you can create a child theme and override within.

This will also help you upgrade to newer version of the Parent Theme. Just replace the old files and continue to make changes to your child theme.
